                shows constantly and always strive to have something new to share with their fans. But even 
                with all that being said everyone gets in a music rut sometimes. Whether you're just getting
                starting or simply feeling burnt out on your current playlist we got you! Just hit play and 
                enjoy a selecting of current and classic EDM songs. Try to give each song a chance, you never
                know which one is going to have a killer drop that gives you goosebumps after the build up!
